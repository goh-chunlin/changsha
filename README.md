## About

This is a simple photo uploading web application with the following features:

1. Login using Google;
2. Uploading of photos;
3. Connecting to backend on Microsoft Azure.

![After Logged in](github-images/homepage-screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Things To Fix

1. Allow logging out from Google;
2. Allow uploading more than one photo;
3. Restrict the file type to be image;
4. Hide the secret key of Azure Function.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
